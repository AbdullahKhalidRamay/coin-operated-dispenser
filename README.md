# Electronic Systems Assignment Coin Operated Water Dispenser
Showing all stages in the process, design and show the implementation of a digital system using D-type flip-flops and the necessary combinatorial logic to meet the following specification:
A coin operated water dispenser for car wash requires 40p for each operation. It can take in coins of value 20p and 10p up to the exact amount. No change is available. Require indicators for ready and next coin.

 
For simplicity, base the programme on a single item. Your report should include the following designs and implementations:

1.	Determine what inputs and outputs are required
Inputs
1.	C10 (10p Coin Input):
o	A toggle button or sensor indicating a 10p coin has been inserted.
o	Type: Binary (1 = coin inserted, 0 = no coin).
2.	C20 (20p Coin Input):
o	A toggle button or sensor indicating a 20p coin has been inserted.
o	Type: Binary (1 = coin inserted, 0 = no coin).
